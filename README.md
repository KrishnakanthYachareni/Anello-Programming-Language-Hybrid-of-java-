develop your own programming anguage
The code in Anello is compiled to Java Byte Code. So, Anello is FULLY COMPATIBLE with other Java classes. Anello parser can convert the Anello program into native java program which can be executed by java compiler which is similar to Java Server Pages. This means all the programs written in Anello programming language use Java classes and vice versa. It is very simple to write the code in Anello. As it is hybrid of java it uses less code and less time. Anello is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate code. 
The language which we would like to develop is simple, try to be natural, encourage organization and comes with transparent and visual implementation. It comes with compact syntax and a group of features that enable the programmer to create natural interfaces and declarative domain-specific languages in a fraction of time. It supports many programming paradigms, comes with useful and practical libraries. The language is designed for productivity and developing high quality solutions that can scale.
